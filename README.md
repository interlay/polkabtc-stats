PolkaBTC Stats API
====
A stats API wrapping a PostgreSQL database, to aggregate and make available historic data about PolkaBTC parachain operation.

Usage
---
Ensure the proper environment variables for the PostgreSQL connection are set.

```shell
yarn install
yarn dev
```
Then navigate to `localhost:3000/docs` for the SwaggerUI, or the defined routes.

*For deployment*, run `yarn start` instead.

Client
----
```shell
#yarn install, if necessary
yarn build
yarn client
```
This builds the client generated from the OpenAPI spec (which can then be published using `yarn publish`.

Autogenerated paths
---
`src/` is the only directory containing hand-written code. Do not edit files in the other directories.

* `build/` contains the OpenAPI server (including the json definition and the routes to be served), generated from the definitons in `src`. Generated using `yarn build`.
* `client/` contains the generated typescript client, as an intermediate step in packaging the client.
* `dist/` contains the compiled client, publishable as an npm package. Generated (alongside `client/`) using `yarn client`.
